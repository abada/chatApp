<h1>TiDAKeyboardControl Module</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Do you want to create a perfect clone of the iMessage compose interface? <strong><em>Fear no more!</em></strong> You can now respond to keyboard events (show, hide and interactive changes) and customize how much space will be used as an offset during interactive panning.</p>
<p>Titanium SDK wrapper for the awesome <a href="https://github.com/danielamitay/DAKeyboardControl">DAKeyboardControl</a> from <a href="http://danielamitay.com">@danielamitay</a>! (iOS only)</p>
<h2>Accessing the TiDAKeyboardControl Module</h2>
<p>What you have to do is just install the module, nothing more!</p>
<p>Thanks to the native implementation using Objective-C categories to extend classes, TiDAKeyboardControl Module does not need the <strong>require( )</strong> method to access the module from JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>keyboardTriggerOffset</code>: <em>number</em>, 
How much space must be took on top of the keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>keyboardPanning</code>: <em>number</em>, This activates the panning feature.</p>
</li>
<li><code>lockedViews</code>: <em>[View]</em>, Automatically add the specified View as a locked view.</li>
</ul>
<p>An extensive example can be found in <code>example/app.js</code>, the following one just acts as an overview.
To clear up every doubts please read <a href="../example/README.md">this</a>.</p>
<p>```js</p>
<p>var textarea = Ti.UI.createTextArea({
    right: 0,
    bottom: 0,
    left: 0,
    scrollable: false,
    suppressReturn: false,
    height: Ti.UI.SIZE,
});</p>
<p>var window = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    keyboardTriggerOffset: 0,
    keyboardPanning: true,
    lockedViews: [ textarea ]
});</p>
<p>window.addEventListener('close', function (event) {
    // Very important! Releases what needs to be released
    event.source.keyboardPanning = false;
});</p>
<p>window.add(textarea);</p>
<p>// The window is now the host for keyboard events
window.addEventListener('keyboardchange', function (event) {
    Ti.API.error("Notification of keyboard change: y=" + event.y + " height="+event.height);
});</p>
<p>// Multiline text-area
textarea.addEventListener('postlayout', function (event) {
    window.keyboardTriggerOffset = event.source.rect.height;
});</p>
<p>window.open();
```</p>
